# 🔧 Netlify Deployment Fix - Dependency Error Resolved

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pinecone-client==3.0.0
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Fixed requirements.txt**
- Changed `pinecone-client==3.0.0` → `pinecone-client==3.2.2` 
- Version 3.0.0 doesn't exist, but 3.2.2 is available and stable

### 2. **Updated netlify.toml**
- Added Python version specification: `PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11"`
- Added build command for better error reporting

### 3. **Created requirements-netlify.txt**
- Alternative requirements file with flexible version ranges
- Use this if main requirements.txt still has issues

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Trigger New Deployment:**
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Click "Deploy latest commit" or push any change to trigger rebuild

2. **Monitor Build Log:**
   - Should now successfully install dependencies
   - The pinecone-client error should be resolved

3. **If Still Failing:**
   - Use the alternative `requirements-netlify.txt`
   - Rename it to `requirements.txt` in your repo

## 📋 **Environment Variables Still Needed:**

Don't forget to add these in Netlify dashboard:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=[Your API Key]
PINECONE_API_KEY=[Your API Key]
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=[Your API Key]
BEARER_TOKEN=[Your Bearer Token]
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=gcp-starter
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=hackrx-documents
NODE_VERSION=18
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**
- ✅ Dependencies install successfully
- ✅ Netlify function builds without errors
- ✅ Your HackRx API endpoint becomes available at your Netlify URL

**The dependency conflict has been resolved! Try deploying again.** 🚀
