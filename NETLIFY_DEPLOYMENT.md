## 📦 **Deployment Steps**

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
# In your project directory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "HackRx 6.0 Document Intelligence Agent - Ready for submission"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hackrx-document-intelligence.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Go to Netlify**: https://netlify.com
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Connect GitHub** and select your repository
4. **Build settings**:

   - **Build command**: `npm install`
   - **Publish directory**: (leave empty)
   - **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions` (auto-detected)

5. **Click "Deploy site"**

### Step 3: Your API URLs

After deployment, your API will be available at:

- **HackRx Endpoint**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/hackrx/run`
- **Function Direct**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/hackrx`

---

## 🧪 **Testing Your Deployed API**

### Test with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-site-name.netlify.app/hackrx/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "documents": "https://hackrx.blob.core.windows.net/assets/policy.pdf?sv=2023-01-03&st=2025-07-04T09%3A11%3A24Z&se=2027-07-05T09%3A11%3A00Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=N4a9OU0w0QXO6AOIBiu4bpl7AXvEZogeT%2FjUHNO7HzQ%3D",
    "questions": [
      "What is the grace period for premium payment under the National Parivar Mediclaim Plus Policy?",
      "What is the waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) to be covered?"
    ]
  }'
```

### Test with Python:

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://your-site-name.netlify.app/hackrx/run"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "documents": "https://hackrx.blob.core.windows.net/assets/policy.pdf?sv=2023-01-03&st=2025-07-04T09%3A11%3A24Z&se=2027-07-05T09%3A11%3A00Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=N4a9OU0w0QXO6AOIBiu4bpl7AXvEZogeT%2FjUHNO7HzQ%3D",
    "questions": [
        "What is the grace period for premium payment?",
        "What is the waiting period for pre-existing diseases?"
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print("Status:", response.status_code)
print("Response:", response.json())
```

## 🔥 **Expected Performance**

### Response Format (Exactly as HackRx requires):

```json
{
  "answers": [
    "A grace period of thirty days is provided for premium payment after the due date to renew or continue the policy without losing continuity benefits.",
    "There is a waiting period of thirty-six (36) months of continuous coverage from the first policy inception for pre-existing diseases and their direct complications to be covered."
  ]
}
```

### Performance Metrics:

- **Response Time**: 5-15 seconds (well under 30s requirement)
- **Availability**: 99.9% (Netlify SLA)
- **HTTPS**: Automatic SSL/TLS
- **Global CDN**: Worldwide edge locations
